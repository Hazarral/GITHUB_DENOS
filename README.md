# PROJECT DENOS

This is a topdown, 2d game with geometric graphic (square, circles, not like low polygon models) roguelike with high difficulty. You play as a square that traverse a map, killing or befriending entities to progress and perhaps kill bosses. I don't have a particular story yet, but that can be worked on later. 

Currently I have the basic movement with dash and aim mechanic. There are more features and systems to come, but I'll need help with those. Things like GUI, skill tree, upgrade paths, XP, GOLD, etc.

The end goal is to make something like Soul Knight and 20 Minutes till dawn, but the mechanic is more intensive, like Dead Cells.

TODO: 
  [x] make an initial readme file :3
  [] make a list of features to do
